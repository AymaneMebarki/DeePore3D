This project pertains to my master's thesis at the University of Leeds.

It is an extension of the existing work of my supervisor Dr. Arash Rabbani where he designed, trained and tested a 2 dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) for the characterisation of porous media.
My project aimed to replicate the process of Dr. Rabbani's work but instead using a 3 dimensional CNN with the hopes of achieving more accurate results.
